This task was completed using php version 7.3.21 and tested locally using WAMP.

This code could be cleaned up and the JS would be extracted into its own files to keep tidier and easier to maintain. 
I would not rely on CDNs for this code either if this went into production.
I would get the chart.JS and Bootstrap files and host them locally.

The time I had I focused on getting a solution to the problem, which I would need futher development. 
This took me just over 6 hours as had to do a bit of testing to make sure timestamp solution was working as I expected.


Some slight changes have been made to the foreach statement checking times, to manipulate the date of today to check for 24 hours as the data was showing
